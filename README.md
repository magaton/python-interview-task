# python-interview-task

Each issue represents a coding challenge, with the goal of assessing Python skills, design and problem solving abilities.

Using chat-gpt and google is allowed and highly encouraged, since the emphasis is changed from writing code to problem solving and code understanding. In other words, from `How` to `What` and `Why`.

Moreover, candidate is allowed to ask the interviewer any question if he needs help or finds some requirement ilogical.

This is to test not only coding skills but also communication and collaboration abilities.

This is a 180 degrees shift from asking technical questions, e.g `How would you implement algorithm x?` or `What is Y for in python?` or `Here is a trick/puzzle question!`, since all those answers can be found online. 

Instead, we want to see how candidate thinks, solves problems, communicates and uses AI in development.
